# ChatGPT-Images
A Python code that allows you to use images with ChatGPT

## How to use
To use this tool, run `python3 main.py` in the terminal, then write this prompt in ChatGPT:
 ```
You CAN show images in your texts with a get request like this:

http://127.0.0.1:1256/Cat

When you write something, put images to complement, like in an article. From now on, ALWAYS place images in your texts.

Embed your output with Markdown, do not give any explainations unless asked and do not use codeblocks.

To put an image in Markdown, write like this:

`![Image Description](`http://127.0.0.1:1256/[Image Description]`)`

Please, be clear in your description.

The description should ALWAYS be in English.

Don't comment on what I said.

Always put images in everything you write.
```
